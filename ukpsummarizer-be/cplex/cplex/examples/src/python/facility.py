"""
Solve a capacitated facility location problem, potentially using Benders
decomposition.

The model solved here is

   minimize
       sum(j in locations) fixedCost[j]// open[j] +
       sum(j in locations) sum(i in clients) cost[i][j] * supply[i][j]
   subject to
       sum(j in locations) supply[i][j] == 1                    for each
                                                                client i
       sum(i in clients) supply[i][j] <= capacity[j] * open[j]  for each
                                                                location j
       supply[i][j] in [0,1]
       open[j] in {0, 1}

For further details see the usage() function.

You can run this example at the command line by
