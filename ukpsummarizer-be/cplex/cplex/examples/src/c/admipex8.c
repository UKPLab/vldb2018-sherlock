/* admipex8.c -- Solve a capacitated facility location problem with cutting
 * planes using the new callback interface.
 * 
 * We are given a set of candidate locations J and a set of clients C.
 * Facilities should be opened in some of the candidate location so that the
 * clients demands can be served. The facility location problem consists in
 * deciding in which locations facilities should be opened and assigning each
 * clients to a facilities at a minimum cost. 
 * 
 * A fixed cost is associated to opening a facility, and a linear cost is
 * associated to the demand supplied from a given facility to a client.
 * 
 * Furthermore, each facility has a capacity and can only serve |C| - 1
 * clients. Note that in the variant of the problem considered here, each
 * client is served by only one facility.
 * 
 * The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program using binary
 * variables: used[j], for all locations j in J, indicating if a facility is
 * opened in location j; supply[c][j], for each client c in C and facility j in
 * J, indicating the demand of client c supplied from facility j.
 * 
 * Then, the following model formulates the facility location problem.
 * 
 *  Minimize sum(j in J) fixedCost[j] * used[j] +
 *           sum(j in J) sum(c in C) cost[c][j] * supply[c][j]
 *  Subject to:
 *    sum(j in J) supply[c][j] == 1                    for all c in C,
 *    sum(c in C) supply[c][j] <= (|C| - 1) * used[j]  for all j in J,
 *    supply[c][j] in {0, 1}                   for all c in C, j in J,
 *    used[j] in {0, 1}                                for all j in J.
 * 
 * The first set of constraints are the demand constraints ensuring that the
 * demand of each client is satisfied. The second set of constraints are the
 * capacity constraints, ensuring that if a facility is placed in location j
 * the capacity of that facility is not exceeded.
 * 
 * The program in this file, formulates a facility location problem and solves
 * it.  Furthermore, different cutting planes methods are implemented using the
 * callback API to help the solution of the problem: 
 * 
 * - Disaggregated capacity cuts separated algorithmically (see function
 *   desegregate for details), 
 * 
 * - Disagregated capacity cuts separated using a cut table (see function
 *   cutsfromtable),
 * 
 * - Capacity constraints separated as lazy constraints (see function
 *   lazycapacity).
 * 
 * Those different methods are invoked using the callback API.
 * 
 * See the usage message for how to switch between these different options.
